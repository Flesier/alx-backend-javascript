let and const
ES6 introduced two new keywords for variable declaration: let and const.

let allows you to declare block-scoped variables that can be reassigned later.
const allows you to declare variables that are constant and cannot be reassigned. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties and elements can still be modified.

Arrow Functions
Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining functions. They automatically bind this to the surrounding context and do not have their own this value.
