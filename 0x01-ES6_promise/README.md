# Promises in ES6

This README provides an overview and usage guide for Promises in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). Promises are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, providing a more organized and readable approach to managing callbacks. This document will cover the basic concepts, syntax, and common use cases of Promises.

## Introduction to Promises

Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a clean and consistent way to work with asynchronous code, making it easier to handle complex sequences of asynchronous tasks.

A Promise can be in one of three states:
- **Pending**: The initial state of a Promise. The operation is still ongoing and hasn't resolved yet.
- **Fulfilled**: The Promise has resolved successfully, and the result is available.
- **Rejected**: The Promise encountered an error or was rejected explicitly.

Promises have a more structured syntax compared to traditional callbacks, improving code readability and reducing callback hell.

## Creating a Promise

To create a new Promise, you can use the `Promise` constructor. It takes a function as an argument, commonly referred to as the "executor." The executor function receives two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. You can call these functions based on the outcome of your asynchronous operation.

Here's an example of creating a simple Promise that resolves after a delay:

```javascript
const delay = (time) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve();
    }, time);
  });
};

// Usage
delay(2000).then(() => {
  console.log("Delay complete!");
});
```

## Promise States

As mentioned earlier, a Promise can be in one of three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, or `rejected`. You can attach handlers to a Promise to handle each state.

```javascript
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
```

The `then` method is used to handle the fulfillment and rejection of a Promise. It takes two optional callback functions: `onFulfilled` and `onRejected`. The `onFulfilled` callback is executed when the Promise is fulfilled, while the `onRejected` callback is executed when the Promise is rejected.

## Chaining Promises

Promises can be chained together to create a sequence of asynchronous operations. The `then` method returns a new Promise, allowing you to chain multiple `then` calls one after another.

```javascript
asyncOperation()
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle result
    return anotherAsyncOperation(result);
  })
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle the result of the second operation
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle errors in any of the previous steps
  });
```

Each `then` call can return a value or another Promise. If a value is returned, it becomes the resolved value of the subsequent Promise. If a Promise is returned, the subsequent Promise will adopt the state of the returned Promise.

## Error Handling

Error handling is an essential aspect of working with Promises. You can use the `catch` method to handle errors in any preceding `then` calls.

```javascript
asyncOperation()
  .then((
