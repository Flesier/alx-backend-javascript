# Class Definition and Methods in ES6

This README provides an overview of class definition and methods in ES6 (ECMAScript 2016) and covers the following topics:

1. How to define a Class
2. How to add methods to a Class
3. Adding a static method to a Class
4. Extending a Class from another
5. Metaprogramming and symbols in ES6

## How to define a Class

In ES6, you can define a Class using the `class` keyword. Here's an example:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor(property1, property2) {
    this.property1 = property1;
    this.property2 = property2;
  }
  
  // Class methods go here
}
```

To create a new instance of the class, use the `new` keyword:

```javascript
const myObject = new MyClass('value1', 'value2');
```

## How to add methods to a Class

To add methods to a Class, define them within the class body. Here's an example:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  // Constructor and properties...
  
  method1() {
    // Method logic here
  }
  
  method2() {
    // Method logic here
  }
}
```

You can call these methods on instances of the class:

```javascript
const myObject = new MyClass();
myObject.method1();  // Call method1
myObject.method2();  // Call method2
```

## Why and how to add a static method to a Class

Static methods belong to the Class itself, rather than instances of the Class. They can be useful for utility functions or operations that don't require access to instance-specific data. To add a static method, use the `static` keyword:

```javascript
class MyClass {
  // Constructor and properties...
  
  static staticMethod() {
    // Static method logic here
  }
}
```

Static methods can be called directly on the Class, without creating an instance:

```javascript
MyClass.staticMethod();  // Call the static method
```

## How to extend a Class from another

To create a class that extends another class, use the `extends` keyword. The derived class inherits properties and methods from the base class:

```javascript
class MyBaseClass {
  // Base class properties and methods...
}

class MyDerivedClass extends MyBaseClass {
  // Derived class properties and methods...
}
```

The derived class can override base class methods or add new methods. To call the base class methods, use the `super` keyword.

## Metaprogramming and symbols in ES6

ES6 introduced metaprogramming capabilities through symbols. Symbols are unique and immutable values that can be used as keys for object properties. They enable advanced operations like creating private members or defining custom behaviors.

To define a symbol, use the `Symbol` function:

```javascript
const mySymbol = Symbol();
```

Symbols can be used as property keys:

```javascript
const myObject = {
  [mySymbol]: 'Value'
};
```

Symbols are typically used in advanced scenarios, and more details on metaprogramming with symbols can be found in the ES6 specification.
